# Hermes Agent — Windows-Specific Quirks

Extracted from SKILL.md August 2026. **Do NOT re-add inline. Update this file.**

## Windows-Specific Quirks

Hermes runs natively on Windows (PowerShell, cmd, Windows Terminal, git-bash
mintty, VS Code integrated terminal). Most of it just works, but a handful
of differences between Win32 and POSIX have bitten us — document new ones
here as you hit them so the next person (or the next session) doesn't
rediscover them from scratch.

### Input / Keybindings

**Alt+Enter doesn't insert a newline.** Windows Terminal intercepts Alt+Enter
at the terminal layer to toggle fullscreen — the keystroke never reaches
prompt_toolkit. Use **Ctrl+Enter** instead. Windows Terminal delivers
Ctrl+Enter as LF (`c-j`), distinct from plain Enter (`c-m` / CR), and the
CLI binds `c-j` to newline insertion on `win32` only (see
`_bind_prompt_submit_keys` + the Windows-only `c-j` binding in `cli.py`).
Side effect: the raw Ctrl+J keystroke also inserts a newline on Windows —
unavoidable, because Windows Terminal collapses Ctrl+Enter and Ctrl+J to
the same keycode at the Win32 console API layer. No conflicting binding
existed for Ctrl+J on Windows, so this is a harmless side effect.

mintty / git-bash behaves the same (fullscreen on Alt+Enter) unless you
disable Alt+Fn shortcuts in Options → Keys. Easier to just use Ctrl+Enter.

**Diagnosing keybindings.** Run `python scripts/keystroke_diagnostic.py`
(repo root) to see exactly how prompt_toolkit identifies each keystroke
in the current terminal. Answers questions like "does Shift+Enter come
through as a distinct key?" (almost never — most terminals collapse it
to plain Enter) or "what byte sequence is my terminal sending for
Ctrl+Enter?" This is how the Ctrl+Enter = c-j fact was established.

### Config / Files

**HTTP 400 "No models provided" on first run.** `config.yaml` was saved
with a UTF-8 BOM (common when Windows apps write it). Re-save as UTF-8
without BOM. `hermes config edit` writes without BOM; manual edits in
Notepad are the usual culprit.

### `execute_code` / Sandbox

**WinError 10106** ("The requested service provider could not be loaded
or initialized") from the sandbox child process — it can't create an
`AF_INET` socket, so the loopback-TCP RPC fallback fails before
`connect()`. Root cause is usually **not** a broken Winsock LSP; it's
Hermes's own env scrubber dropping `SYSTEMROOT` / `WINDIR` / `COMSPEC`
from the child env. Python's `socket` module needs `SYSTEMROOT` to locate
`mswsock.dll`. Fixed via the `_WINDOWS_ESSENTIAL_ENV_VARS` allowlist in
`tools/code_execution_tool.py`. If you still hit it, echo `os.environ`
inside an `execute_code` block to confirm `SYSTEMROOT` is set. Full
diagnostic recipe in `references/execute-code-sandbox-env-windows.md`.

### Testing / Contributing

**`scripts/run_tests.sh` doesn't work as-is on Windows** — it looks for
POSIX venv layouts (`.venv/bin/activate`). The Hermes-installed venv at
`venv/Scripts/` has no pip or pytest either (stripped for install size).
Workaround: install `pytest + pytest-xdist + pyyaml` into a system Python
3.11 user site, then invoke pytest directly with `PYTHONPATH` set:

```bash
"/c/Program Files/Python311/python" -m pip install --user pytest pytest-xdist pyyaml
export PYTHONPATH="$(pwd)"
"/c/Program Files/Python311/python" -m pytest tests/foo/test_bar.py -v --tb=short -n 0
```

Use `-n 0`, not `-n 4` — `pyproject.toml`'s default `addopts` already
includes `-n`, and the wrapper's CI-parity guarantees don't apply off POSIX.

**POSIX-only tests need skip guards.** Common markers already in the codebase:
- Symlinks — elevated privileges on Windows
- `0o600` file modes — POSIX mode bits not enforced on NTFS by default
- `signal.SIGALRM` — Unix-only (see `tests/conftest.py::_enforce_test_timeout`)
- Winsock / Windows-specific regressions — `@pytest.mark.skipif(sys.platform != "win32", ...)`

Use the existing skip-pattern style (`sys.platform == "win32"` or
`sys.platform.startswith("win")`) to stay consistent with the rest of the
suite.

### Path / Filesystem

**Line endings.** Git may warn `LF will be replaced by CRLF the next time
Git touches it`. Cosmetic — the repo's `.gitattributes` normalizes. Don't
let editors auto-convert committed POSIX-newline files to CRLF.

**Forward slashes work almost everywhere.** `C:/Users/...` is accepted by
every Hermes tool and most Windows APIs. Prefer forward slashes in code
and logs — avoids shell-escaping backslashes in bash.

### Troubleshooting

### Voice not working
1. Check `stt.enabled: true` in config.yaml
2. Verify provider: `pip install faster-whisper` or set API key
3. In gateway: `/restart`. In CLI: exit and relaunch.

### Tool not available
1. `hermes tools` — check if toolset is enabled for your platform
2. Some tools need env vars (check `.env`)
3. `/reset` after enabling tools

### Model/provider issues
1. `hermes doctor` — check config and dependencies
2. `hermes auth` — re-authenticate OAuth providers (or `hermes auth add <provider>`)
3. Check `.env` has the right API key
4. **Copilot 403**: `gh auth login` tokens do NOT work for Copilot API. You must use the Copilot-specific OAuth device code flow via `hermes model` → GitHub Copilot.

### Fedora Silverblue / rpm-ostree hosts
Hermes' Docker terminal backend needs Docker to exist on the host. On Silverblue, install Docker Engine by layering the Docker RPMs with `rpm-ostree`, rebooting, then enabling the daemon. Keep the concise recipe in `references/silverblue-docker.md`.

### Changes not taking effect
- **Tools/skills:** `/reset` starts a new session with updated toolset
- **Config changes:** In gateway: `/restart`. In CLI: exit and relaunch.
- **Code changes:** Restart the CLI or gateway process

### Skills not showing
1. `hermes skills list` — verify installed
2. `hermes skills config` — check platform enablement
3. Load explicitly: `/skill name` or `hermes -s name`

### Gateway issues
Check logs first:
```bash
grep -i "failed to send\|error" ~/.hermes/logs/gateway.log | tail -20
```

Common gateway problems:
- **Gateway dies on SSH logout**: Enable linger: `sudo loginctl enable-linger $USER`
- **Gateway dies on WSL2 close**: WSL2 requires `systemd=true` in `/etc/wsl.conf` for systemd services to work. Without it, gateway falls back to `nohup` (dies when session closes).
- **Gateway crash loop**: Reset the failed state: `systemctl --user reset-failed hermes-gateway`

### Platform-specific issues
- **Discord bot silent**: Must enable **Message Content Intent** in Bot → Privileged Gateway Intents.
- **Slack bot only works in DMs**: Must subscribe to `message.channels` event. Without it, the bot ignores public channels.
- **Windows-specific issues** (`Alt+Enter` newline, WinError 10106, UTF-8 BOM config, test suite, line endings): see the dedicated **Windows-Specific Quirks** section above.

### Auxiliary models not working
If `auxiliary` tasks (vision, compression, session_search) fail silently, the `auto` provider can't find a backend. Either set `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` or `GOOGLE_API_KEY`, or explicitly configure each auxiliary task's provider:
```bash
hermes config set auxiliary.vision.provider <your_provider>
hermes config set auxiliary.vision.model <model_name>
```
